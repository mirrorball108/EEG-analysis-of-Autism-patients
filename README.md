# EEG-analysis-of-Autism-patients
This project classifies EEG data from autism patients pre- and post-treatment using SVM and Random Forest. It includes ANOVA, boxplots, Poincar√© plots, and fractal dimensions (e.g., Hausdorff) for feature analysis. Three data setups were tested to identify EEG-based biomarkers of treatment impact.
